This code suffers from a subtle issue related to PHP's type juggling and the behavior of the `==` operator.  In PHP, `==` performs loose comparison, meaning it may perform type coercion before comparison. This can lead to unexpected results.

```php
<?php
$a = 0;
$b = 'abc';

if ($a == $b) {
  echo '$a is equal to $b';
} else {
  echo '$a is not equal to $b';
}
?>
```

The comparison `$a == $b` evaluates to `true` because PHP converts the string 'abc' to an integer (0) before the comparison, leading to 0 == 0 which is true. This is a common error when developers expect strict comparison (`===`).
