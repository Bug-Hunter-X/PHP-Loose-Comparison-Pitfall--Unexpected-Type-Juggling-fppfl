# PHP Loose Comparison Pitfall

This repository demonstrates a common pitfall in PHP programming involving loose comparison (`==`) and type juggling.  The code showcases how loose comparison can lead to unexpected results due to implicit type conversions.

## The Problem

PHP's loose comparison operator (`==`) performs type coercion before comparison.  This can lead to seemingly illogical results, particularly when comparing numerical strings with numbers or null values with other data types.  This example highlights a scenario where a numerical string is treated as a number in a comparison operation. 

## The Solution

The solution is to use strict comparison (`===`) which avoids type coercion and enforces exact type matching for accurate and predictable comparisons.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the `bug.php` and `bugSolution.php` files using a PHP interpreter.
